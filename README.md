**Description:**
This is a simple Number Guessing Game written in Python.
The program randomly chooses a number between 1 and 50, and the player has 5 attempts to guess it correctly.
After each guess, the program gives hints to help the player â€” for example, whether the guess is too high, too low, or very close to the correct answer.
If the player guesses the correct number, a random celebration message appears.
If not, the correct number is revealed after all attempts are used.

**How it works:**
Guess a number between 1 and 50: 25
Too low! You're getting closer!
Guess a number between 1 and 50: 35
Too high! You're very close!
Guess a number between 1 and 50: 33
Awesome! You guessed it in 3 tries!
